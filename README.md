# andela-day-3-lab
This repository holds my project lab for day 3. It contains 2 function projects including their test cases, dependencies and an HTML Lab. The function projects are Search (which performs a binary search of a number on an array), it is dependent on three other functions toTwenty, toForty and toOneThousand and findMissing function project which takes in as argument, two arrays from which one has elements of the other, short by one. We are to find the missing element. For the HTML/CSS Lab, a simple clone UI is implemented with HTML and CSS.
